# url_shortener
Design and implement a URL shortener service that uses RESTful APIs. The service should allow users to submit a valid URL and receive a unique short URL in return, which will redirect to the original URL when accessed. Additionally, the service should include an expiry mechanism for the short URLs and track certain performance metrics.
